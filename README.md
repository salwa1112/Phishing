# Phishing
Phishing is the way to display a fake website as an authentic source in order to get the credentials of the victim and unfortunately it is a very common attack.
It is impossible to distinguish the original site from the fake one and the only way is by looking at the URL.
As it is in PHP, this can be hosted on a platform https://in.000webhost.com/ for free.
I have created the login page in html.
